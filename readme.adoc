= Writing DITA with Vim

== Introduction

This topic records my best practices for using Vim to write DITA topics.
It can, of course, be applied to any XML topic and even HTML topics.

== Setting up autocomplete

Autocomplete has limited usefulness I think because it can take longer to enter an element this way than typing it.
However, if you do want to use it, set up a folder to work in and open the first file in its own instance of Vim.
This allows you to use autocomplete that limits terms to only those in the project.
If you work on XML files in a tab with lots of other buffers open, you will have unrelated terms when you attempt to use autocomplete.

For autocomplete, use ctrl-n.

== Adding the template

There are several options for adding the basic topic template

=== Option 1: Use a mapping in the vimrc

----
" DITA snippets
noremap <leader>dt a<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><CR><!DOCTYPE task PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DITA Task//EN" "task.dtd"><CR><task id=""><CR><taskbody><CR><title>Title</title><CR></taskbody><CR></task><ESC>
noremap <leader>dc a<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><CR><!DOCTYPE concept PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DITA Concept//EN" "concept.dtd"><CR><concept id=""><CR><conbody><CR><title>Title</title><CR></conbody><CR></concept><ESC>
----

=== Option 2: Read in the text from a file

Set up a file for each template

For a task topic, add the following to a topic called `task`.
By not giving it an extension, you will know that it is a partial.

----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE task PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DITA Task//EN" "task.dtd">
<task id="">
  <taskbody>
    <title>Title</title>
  </taskbody>
</task>
----

For a concept topic, add the following to a file called `concept`.

----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE concept PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DITA Concept//EN" "concept.dtd">
<concept id="">
  <conbody>
    <title>Title</title>
  </conbody>
</concept>
----

To read in the file:

. Open a buffer and give it a filename.
. Change the working directory to the `templates` folder.
. Read in the template with `:0r task`.

The `0` in front of `r` ensures the text is read into line 1, preventing a blank line at the top of the buffer.

By keeping the `templates` folder as the working directory it is simpler to read in files.

The advantage of this method is that you don't have to clutter up your vimrc.
The disadvantage is that you have to copy the template files into your working directory, or have them in a different location.
Probably, the best way to do this is to use a folder called `templates` for all the templates you can read in.

== Adding a table

Tables are the most complicated structures in XML.
The best way to add a table is to read one in from a separate template file.
Set the working directory to the `templates` folder.

. Position your cursor at the end of the line below where you want to place the table.
. :r table2col

== Adding an GUID ID attribute

. Create a file with a list of ID attributes, such as GUIDs copied from a generator application.
. Open the file in a vertical split to the left of the XML file you are working on.
. Place your cursor on the opening quotation mark where you want to paste the ID.
. Use ctrl-h to jump to the GUID file.
. Cut one ID with `diW`.
+
You need to cut it so you don't use the same ID twice.
Also, by using diW, you don't copy the newline character that will cause the line to split after pasting.

. ctrl-l to jump back to the XML file location to paste into.
. p to paste.

== Entering text in between existing tags

To enter text in between existing tags:

. Jump to the line with the element.
. Anywhere on the line use `cit` to enter insert mode inside the tags.
. Start typing.

== Adding a pair of tags

With the xml.vim filetype in use, it is easy to add a pair of tags.
Type the first tag and press enter.
The closing tag is automatically added.
To add a newline so you can add a second child tag, simply press enter twice.

== Wrapping text in an element

This method relies on the xml.vim filetype.

For inline elements, you need to wrap the text to be bolded etc.

To wrap text as you type: 

. Mid sentence, type the name of the wrapper element and stay in Insert mode.
. Type `;;`.
. Type the name of the word to put in the wrapper element.

To wrap multiple words after they are already typed:

. Select some text with visual mode.
+
For example, place the cursor at the start and type `v2e` to select the next two words.

. Type `\v` to place a tag around it.
. Enter the name of the element in the dialog box.
. Optionally enter an attribute for the element.

== Adding images

The syntax for an image is shown in this example.

[source,xml]
----
<image href="bike.gif" placement="break" align="center" width="400">
  <alt>Two-wheeled bicycle</alt>
</image>
----

=== Method 1

It may be fastest to just copy another image and paste it, so it comes in with the attributes.
Then, replace the image name.

=== Method 2

I have also created an `image` file that you can read in.

. Position your cursor at the end of the line below where you want to place the image.
. :r image
. Replace the href filename.

I think this is the fastest method, especially if the working directory is the `templates` folder.

== Adding cross-references

References: 
https://www.oxygenxml.com/dita/styleguide/webhelp-feedback/Artefact/Cross_Referencing/c_Cross-references_Sample_Topic.html#concept_sample_xref
https://idratherbewriting.com/cross_references/

The general structure of a cross-reference is:

* Target topic file name 
* Target topic topic ID (with preceeding #)
* Target topic element name (with preceeding /)

<filename>#<topic-id>/<topic-element>

I guess this structure allows for a file to have multiple topics nested inside it.

Here is the text inside a target file called mytopic.xml.

[source,xml]
----
<concept id="mytopicid">
...
<section id="myelementid">
<title>Date Selection</title>
...
----

Here is the source:

[source,xml]
----
<p> 
Select the date range you want. See the previous section, 
<xref href="mytopic.xml#mytopicid/myelementid type="section"/>
, for details about the options.
</p>
----

I made a file for reading in this element, stored in `templates/xref`.

. Position your cursor at the end of the line below where you want to place the cross-reference.
. :r xref
. Replace the name of the topic, name of the topic id and name of the element id.

== Adding conrefs

Set up a warehouse file to store the conrefs.
In this example, the file is called `warehouse-filename.xml`.

Then, in the warehouse file, set up the element structure and the element content that you want to link in.
[source,xml]
----
<topic id="warehouse-topic-id">
   ...
  <note type="warning" id="warehouse-element-id">Don't awaken sleeping dragons.</note>
----

To, reference the include, use this syntax:

[source,xml]
----
<note conref="warehouse-filename.xml#warehouse-topic-id/warehouse-element-id"/>
----

I have stored this in `templates/conref` for reading into the file in Vim.

. Position your cursor at the end of the line below where you want to place the conref.
. :r conref
. Replace the name of the topic, name of the topic id and name of the element id.

NOTE: The syntax of a conref link is the the same as a cross-reference link.

You have to give the filename and topic id because a file may have more than one topic (nested) in it.

== Using ALE and XMLlint for linting

You can lint XML files using xmllint and the plugin ALE.

First, make sure that xmllint is installed.
Also, make sure the ALE plugin is loaded from the vimrc.

[source,vim]
----
" Plug 'dense-analysis/ale'
Plug 'w0rp/ale'
" post install (yarn install | npm install) then load plugin only for editing supported files
----

Then make sure ALE plugin settings are included in the vimrc.

----
" .............................................................................
" ALE plugin settings
" .............................................................................

let g:ale_html_tidy_executable = "C:\Program Files\tidy-5.6.0-vc14-64b\bin\tidy.exe"
" Maybe need to turn off tidy here and in the html linters section below if it reports an error.

let g:ale_fixers = {
\   '*': ['remove_trailing_lines', 'trim_whitespace'],
\   'javascript': ['eslint'],
\   'html': ['tidy', 'prettier'],
\   'css': ['stylelint', 'prettier'],
\   'xml': ['xmllint'],
\}

let g:ale_fix_on_save = 0       " Use 1 to activate - run :ALEFix instead if you want to manually fix a file
let g:ale_linters_explicit = 1
let g:ale_lint_on_text_changed = 'never'   " Only activate on save
let g:ale_lint_on_enter = 0    " start when GVim starts = 1. to turn it off use 0
let g:ale_sign_column_always = 1 " 1 keeps the sign column open at all times

let g:ale_linters = {
 \   'css': ['stylelint', 'prettier'],
 \   'html': ['tidy', 'prettier'],
 \   'javascript': ['eslint'],
 \   'xml': ['xmllint'],
 \}

" let g:CSSLint_FileTypeList = ['css', 'less', 'sass'] " Activates csslint for use in Vim with css files - using stylelint
let g:ale_set_highlights = 0  " 1 allows highlights for text symbols in the column, 0 disables
" highlight ALEWarning ctermbg=DarkMagenta

let g:ale_sign_error = 'x'
" let g:ale_sign_warning = '!'
" let g:ale_sign_error = '‚ö†Ô∏è' "Less aggressive than the default '>>'
" let g:ale_sign_error = '‚ñ≤'
let g:ale_sign_warning = 'üí°'
"let g:ale_echo_msg_warning_str = 'Warning üì£'
"let g:ale_echo_msg_error_str = '‚ùß Error'
" highlight clear ALEErrorSign
" highlight clear ALEWarningSign
let g:ale_open_list = 1  "  can be useful if combining ALE with another plugin
let g:ale_keep_list_window_open = 1

" Bind F12 to fixing problems with ALE
nmap <F12> <Plug>(ale_fix)

== Validating topics

Need to figure out the best way to do this.
I can do this if I have the XML file in a folder structure that contains the relevant DTD file. 
I use the command in vimrc to run the vaidation using XMLlint.

I should probably put the DTD files in the `templates` folder or a separate `dtd` folder.
That would make it easier.

== Validating a publication

I can do this in Oxygen, but I don't think it's possible to do this is in Vim.
